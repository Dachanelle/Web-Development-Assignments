		broadcast the skills that I have acquired as well as to show how well I know how to use "HTML" and "CSS". I have included my resume on this webpage which will show how well i can use these skills
	       The resume is a HTML file that I have created using notepad and linked a CSS file to add special features to make it look presentable. Click "My Resume" below to see my resume.</p>
